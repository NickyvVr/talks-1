# A/B Testing in React: Building Data-Driven UI

## Abstract
Building a good UI is hard. Building a good UI that will delight your users is even harder. By incorporating A/B testing into your UI, you can stop guessing what your users love and start making data-driven UI decisions! 

## Description
### Objectives
* Explain what A/B testing is and why it's an important step in the product development lifecycle
* Explain how to run meaningful and well-executed experiments at a high level
* Show a live coding example of how to add A/B testing to an existing React app

This talk can be presented in two ways: 
- Partially slides for the intro information and partially live coding for the implementation of the A/B testing in code. This usually results in a talk that's about 45 - 50 minutes long, with some time for Q&A.
- Partially slides for the intro information and partially slides that walk through the steps of coding an implementation of the A/B testing. This usually results in a talk that's about 30 minutes long, with some time for Q&A.
