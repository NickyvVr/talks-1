# Designing for the Extremes
## Abstract
Accessibility should never be an afterthought. Imagine excluding 15% of your users right off the bat! Instead, what if we designed for the extremes? For visually impaired users? For hearing impaired users? In this talk, we’ll explore how to ditch the standard persona model when designing a product and focus on designing for those typically considered “edge case” users from the get go.

Length: 30-60 mins

Level: Beginner

## Description
### Objectives
* Provide an overview into the global userbase and a breakdown of those who deviate from the "average" user
* Provide an overview of the standard design process - using personas, designing for the average user, etc
* Explain the shortcomings for this mindset and how we can shift that mindset to be more inclusive
* Show how modern, innovative technologies are emerging from this paradigm of designing for those outside the average user
* Discuss various types of disabilities that require accommodations within the product

This talk is aimed at bringing to light how drastically disabled users are excluded by designs that default to catering to the average user and how important (and easy!) it is to design for the extremes - for both accessibility and power user scenarios. This talk also provides insight to how designing for the extremes creates a more polished experience and better product.
