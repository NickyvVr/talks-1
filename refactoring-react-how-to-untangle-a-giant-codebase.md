# Refactoring React: How to untangle a giant codebase
## Abstract
Imagine this: it’s your first day in a new codebase and you’re pumped! You open a component file and there it is... your worst nightmare. The file’s thousands of lines long - and it’s just supposed to be a presentational component!

In this talk, we’ll deep dive into the file structure of a React app, what the “holy grail” of a component should look like, and how to elegantly refactor your existing components without taking down the entire app.

Length: 30 - 60 mins

Level: Intermediate / Expert

## Description
### Objectives
* Explore common strategies for structuring your React app
* Deep dive into a large React component and how to approach refactoring into more reusable pieces
* Provide an overview on structuring React components to separate concerns between business and presentational logic

The format of this talk will be a 30 to 60 minute deep dive (can be adapted for various timeslots). No live coding will be included, but I’ll go over code itself on the slides.
The talk will start with an overview of how React components should be structured with a separation of concerns - breaking down presentational components from those that deal with Redux or GraphQL calls and how styling is set up. Then I’ll jump into a demo of how I approach refactoring components that aren’t structured that way and show step by step refactoring a complex component into various smaller, more reusable pieces.
