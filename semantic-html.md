This talk is aimed at beginners in the tech industry, whether students or those transitioning from another field. As someone who was deeply involved in the recruitment process for Microsoft during my time as an engineer there, I've picked up on the types of struggles both student and industry hires typically face and can give the inside scoop on how to set yourself up for success. This talk will be mostly slide-based and will provide various resources for studying after the talk is over.
