# Localization vs Internationalization: Shipping to Global Users
## Abstract
Only 10% of users worldwide are English speakers, so we know that shipping a product at a global scale is both necessary and difficult. You hear all this talk about localization and internationalization, but all you know is that you want your app to be usable by every user on the planet.

In this talk, weâ€™ll explore the differences between localization and internationalization and how to implement them in your React app!

## Description
### Objectives
* Cover localization and interationalization and the differences between both
* Provide a deep dive into implementing things needed for both localization and interationalization to prepare a product to ship for global users

This talk will be slides-based and will start with an overview on localization and interationalization and the differences between the two. Then we'll deep dive into tools and techniques for implementing what's necessary for achieved a product ready to ship globally and cover how to test those implemenations locally.
